## What's here

This repository includes a set of exercises designed to help people learn RobotFramework. It is set up use along side the course as delivered to the client. Students attending the course may use this repository to prepare, study, and support their learnings before, during and after training is delivered and while employeed at BCBSWNY (HealthNow).

We encourage trainees to clone this repository, modify it locally and work together with other trainees to learn RobotFramework.


## A note on this course
This course was customized for HealthNow for the Software & QA Leadership team at HealthNow by Beaufort Fairmont, LLC cooperation with Zenergy Technologies.

Each exercise correlates to a learning segment in the planned curriculum (starting with “Introduction” and ending with “Exercise 40”). Each section includes “Purpose” and “Learning Objectives” to help the trainee better understand the curriculum.

Exercise numbering is for internal (Beaufort Fairmont) purposes and identification. Numbering is key in planning and traceability, please do not change exercise numbers.

This document lists exercises in the order they are planned to be delivered. The instructor may have a need to change the ordering during delivery for the benefit of the students and the client.

Zenergy Technologies and Beaufort Fairmont appreciate your business and enjoy working with the team at HealthNow!
