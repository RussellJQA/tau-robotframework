# Tear Down Revisited

## Purpose: 
To learn about cleaning up test data using teardown.

## Learning Objectives:

- Automators will be able to clean up data created for the test case as a part of suite teardown.

##Challenge: 
Clean up the data you created (invoices). `Hint: Teardown & “Run Keywords” pair nicely. “Set Suite Variable” will be key to use ${invoiceNumber} in teardown`.
(15 Min)

**Extra Credit:** Sign the random data you’ve created for invoice so that you can find it (clean it up) later. Be able to back up why you signed it the way you did. Extra Extra Credit: Clean up the data your test created every time this test runs.
